    "### Stack ADT:\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack ADT (Abstract Data Type) behaves how a real-world stack would; for example, a deck of card. You can place or take a card from the top of a stack only. Similarly with a stack ADT, it only allows data operations at one end only.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature implements a LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first out. The element that is inserted or added last is accessed first. The insertion operation is called <b>Push</b> and the removal operation is called <b>Pop</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Stack contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order. All operations take place at a single end that is top of the stack and we will now discuss the operations can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The key operations for the stack ADT include:\n",
    "- <b>push</b>: Insert an element at one end of the stack called top.\n",
    "- <b>pop</b>: Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The support operations for the stack ADT include:\n",
    "- <b>peek</b>: Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it, if the stack is not empty.\n",
    "- <b>size</b>: Return the number of elements in the stack.\n",
    "- <b>isEmpty</b>: Return true if the stack is empty, otherwise return false.\n",
    "- <b>isFull</b>: Return true if the stack is full, otherwise return false.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "One real world data example of a stack ADT is for the back button on a web browser or similarly the undo/redo option within Excel or Word. This operation is accomplished by keeping all text changes in a stack. Each action in your editor generates a new undo command that goes into the undo stack. Each undo action generates the corresponding redo command that goes into the redo stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another real world data example is for language processing. Space for parameters and local variables is created internally using a stack. As well as this, the compiler's syntax for matching braces is implemented by using a stack.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "### Queue ADT:\n",
    "\n",
    "The queue ADT (Abstract Data Type) is analogous to how queues function in real-life. We impose an order on a list of objects based on the order in which the objects have been added to the list. Queues work on a First-In First-Out <b>(FIFO)</b> basis. Items are inserted at the rear <b>(enqueued)</b> and removed from the front <b>(dequeued)</b>. The item that has been in the queue for the longest time, gets served first. The only accessible item in the queue is the one at the front. This item must be dequeued before the item behind it is available for access. Items added to the queue are added at the rear and are not accessible until after all preceding items have been dequeued.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data structure has many useful applications in computer science. Any application where only one request is processed at a time but the rate of receiving requests may be faster than the rate of processing would be a candidate for using a queue data structure. In such cases a queue may act as a buffer with an imposed order which ensures requests are processed in the order they arrived.\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue contains elements of the same type arranged in sequential order. Operations take place at both ends, insertion is done at the end and deletion is done at the front. We will now the disccuss the operations that can be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "As we touched on briefly, the key operations for the queue ADT include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>enqueue</b>: This operation takes an object and adds it to the rear of a queue.\n",
    "- <b>dequeue</b>: This operation removes an object at the head of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as the key operations, there is also support operations, which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>size</b>: This operation returns the number of objects contained in the queue.\n",
    "- <b>is_empty</b>: This operation returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "- <b>front</b>: This operation returns the object at the front of the queue. This can also be called \"Peek\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "One real world data example of a Queue can be seen in Operating systems for job scheduling. The OS maintains a separate queue for each of the process states and PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue. When the state of a process is changed, its PCB is unlinked from its current queue and moved to its new state queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second real world data example can be seen in Disk scheduling or I/O scheduling. Multiple requests may arrive by different processes, however only one request can be handled at a time by the disk controller. Therefore, other I/O requests need to be put into the queue and need to be scheduled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final real world data example we will look at is Breadth First Search (BFS), which is an algorithm for traversing graph data strcutures. BFS leans on the queue data structure and works by traversing all the nodes in the graph and drops them when they are completed. BFS visits an adjacent unvisited node, marks it as done, and inserts it into a queue."

As stated, in each of the graphs, the time complexity of O(1) can be seen, as expected. We then discussed the <b>Efficiency</b>, <b>Clarity</b> and <b>Correctness</b> of the notebook. To illustrate the <b>Maintainability</b>, we implemented 9 unit tests which all run successfully."
